Wizard -------

= #1 = Select Event Type =====

The most common Event Types I will be using are:

1 - BeforeFieldChange 
	- Ex: validate textbox values. If bad... Stop the user and force to enter a new value. 
	- This expects a Table & Field(s)
	- 1 event per table
	- Each table can have 1 or more Fields

2 - AfterFieldChange - Ex: cannot stop user... Can "extend functionality" of that field after. 
	- This expects a Table & Field(s)
	- 1 event per table
	- Each table can have 1 or more Fields


3 - EpiViewNotification - Ex: default values when creating a new record. 
	- This expects a DataView. 
	- 1 Event for each view.

4 - BeforeAdapterMethod - Ex: Most common! Validations before executing a business method on the server. 
	- This expects Adapters. 
	- 1 event for each adapter.

5 - AfterAdaptermethod - Ex: Extend the functionality of the whatever you're doing. 
	- This expects Adapters
	- 1 event for each adapter.
